[Entries] is a list of key-value pairs, with unique keys.<br>
📦 [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extra-iterable),
🌐 [Web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extra-iterable.web),
📜 [Files](https://unpkg.com/extra-iterable/),
📰 [Docs](https://nodef.github.io/extra-iterable/),
📘 [Wiki](https://github.com/nodef/extra-iterable/wiki/).

All functions except `from*()` take entries as 1st parameter, and expect it
to be [iterable]. It does not need to be an array. **Entries** are returned
by `Array`, `Object`, `Set`, `Map`.

This package is available in *Node.js* and *Web* formats. The web format
is exposed as `extra_entries` standalone variable and can be loaded from
[jsDelivr CDN].
